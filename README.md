# Python-Global-Warming-Guided-Visualization
The dataset is derived from several samples of ice from the Vostok region (Petit et al, 1999)collected from different layers and therefore containing different amounts of CO2. Due to the different arrangements of the firn grains in several different depths (the more profound the layer, the more dense it is), bubbles containing gas from distinct ages are trapped into the ice. The sample containing the gas is further analyzed to compare atmospheres from different eons. To understand the patterns and hidden relationships on the data set, data visualization will be provided.
